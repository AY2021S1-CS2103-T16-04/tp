## Project: ScheDar

ScheDar is a desktop task manage system that helps user manage their daily tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to search through tasks. [\#51](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-4/tp/pull/51)
  * What it does: Allows the user to type multiple keywords and match with description and title
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user with many tasks can find the task they want immediately.
