## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/schedar/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/schedar/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/schedar/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/schedar/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `TaskManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task, such as ToDo).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/schedar/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the task manager data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/schedar/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the task manager data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.schedar.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding Tasks

#### Implementation

ScheDar supports 3 types of tasks: `ToDo`s, `Deadline`s, and `Event`s. As the 3 types of tasks share many common attributes and features, such as a title, description, and priority level, they all inherit from the same abstract class `Task`. Some attributes, like dates, are only relevant to some types of tasks, such as `Deadline`, and are thus not present in the other types such as `ToDo`.

Each type of task has it own corresponding command to add that specific type of task. All of the commands extend the `Command` class. Currently, the commands are:
* `AddTodoCommand` for `ToDo`-type Tasks
* `AddDeadlineCommand` for `Deadline`-type Tasks
* `AddEventCommand` for `Event`-type Tasks

![TaskCommandClass](images/TaskClassDiagram.png)

All of the commands extend the `Command` class. However, as each type of task stores different types of variables as required (such as date or time), each task may have different command parameters, and thus would need to be parsed differently. Thus, each command is given its own class for simplicity and extendability.

Given below is an example for adding a `Deadline`-type task to ScheDar:

Step 1: The user inputs the command `deadline t/taskTitle p/high date/2020-10-11`, which is supposed to create a `Deadline`-type Task, with a title `taskTitle`, priority `High`, and deadline date of 11 October 2020. Description and tags, which are optional, have been omitted.

Step 2: The input command is passed into `LogicManager` from the UI.

Step 3: `LogicManager` calls on the `parseCommand()` method of `TaskManagerParser` to parse the command. Upon recognising the input as a command to add a `Deadline`-type task, `TaskManagerParser` calls on `AddDeadlineCommandParser` to process the input parameters.

Step 4: `AddDeadlineCommandParser` calls on the `tokenize` method of `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the commands into an `ArgumentMultiMap`. It then extracts the values for each command parameter, and uses them to create the `Deadline` object.

Step 5: `AddDeadlineCommandParser` uses the `Deadline` object to create an `AddDeadlineCommand` object, which is returned to `TaskManagerParser`, then `LogicManager` for execution.

Step 6: `LogicManager` calls on the `execute()` method of the `AddDeadlineCommand` object, which adds the `Deadline` to the ScheDar's task manager.

Step 7: Upon successful execution, a `CommandResult` object is created, and returned to `LogicManager` and then the UI, where a success message is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how a typical add operation, as explained in steps 2 to 7 above, works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How different Task types are implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each type of task is its own class, which inherits from `Task`.
  * Pros: Allows different types of tasks to have different variables and task-specific behaviour. For example, in future, `Deadline`-type tasks can have reminders, but not `ToDo` or `Event`.
  * Cons: Managing `Task`s of different classes within the same task manager adds complexity.

* **Alternative 2:** Have a single `Task` class, with some attributes such as dates, being optional.
  * Pros: Only a single type of `Task` to manage. Less error prone.
  * Cons: Difficult to extend or customise behaviour for the different types of tasks.

##### Aspect: How commands to add different types of tasks are implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each type of task has its own add command, such as `todo` and `deadline`.
  * Pros: The parser would be aware of the type of task being added, and can show the user an error message if an invalid parameter is added, such as a date to a `ToDo`-type task.
  * Cons: There are multiple add commands, and the commands are longer, making the process more inconvenient for users.

* **Alternative 2:** Have a single `add` command, with the type of task being determined by the attributes supplied by the user, or a separate parameter like `/todo`.
  * Pros: User only needs to know a single command to add tasks.
  * Cons: The logic needed to process the command would be more complex, and thus may be more prone to errors.
  
### Count Tasks

#### Implementation

ScheDar has the ability to count the number of tasks in current task list.

Given below is an example for counting tasks.

Step 1: The user inputs the command `count`.

Step 2: The input command is passed into `LogicManager` from the UI.

Step 3: `LogicManager` calls on the `parseCommand()` method of `TaskManagerParser` to parse the command. Upon recognising the input as a count command, `TaskManagerParser` calls on `CountCommandParser` to process the input parameters.

Step 4: `CountCommandParser` creates a `CountCommand` object, which is returned to `TaskManagerParser`, then `LogicManager` for execution.

Step 5: `LogicManager` calls on the `execute()` method of the `CountCommand` object, which counts the tasks in ScheDar.

Step 6: Upon successful execution, a `CommandResult` object is created, and returned to `LogicManager` and then the UI, where a success message is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how a typical add operation, as explained in steps 2 to 6 above, works:

![CountSequenceDiagram](images/CountSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: Displays more statistics details to user

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display only the total number of tasks to the user.
  * Pros: Easier to implement. Less error prone.
  * Cons: Information displayed to user is limited.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Display the total number of tasks as well as the number of tasks of each type (todo/event/deadline), and the number of done/undone tasks. 
  * Pros: Displays more useful information to the user.
  * Cons: More error prone.
  
* Alternative 1 can be extended to Alternative 2. Due to time limit, we did not implement the extension.

### Editing Tasks

#### Implementation

Similar to add command, each type of task has it own corresponding edit command. All of the commands extend the `Command` class. Currently, the commands are:
* `EditTodoCommand` for `ToDo`-type Tasks
* `EditDeadlineCommand` for `Deadline`-type Tasks
* `EditEventCommand for `Event`-type Tasks

As each type of task stores different types of variables as required (such as date or time), each task may have different command parameters, and thus would need to be parsed differently. 

Given below is an example for editing a `ToDo`-type task.

Step 1: The user inputs the command `editTodo 1 t/project`, which is supposed to edit`ToDo` at index `1` with a new title `project`.

Step 2: The input command is passed into `LogicManager` from the UI.

Step 3: `LogicManager` calls on the `parseCommand()` method of `TaskManagerParser` to parse the command. Upon recognising the input as a command to edit a `ToDo`-type task, `TaskManagerParser` calls on `EditTodoCommandParser` to process the input parameters.

Step 4: `EditTodoCommandParser` calls on the `tokenize` method of `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the commands into an `ArgumentMultiMap`. It then extracts the values for each command parameter, and uses them to create the `EditTodoDescriptor` object.

Step 5: `EditTodoCommandParser` uses the `EditTodoDescriptor` object to create an `EditTodoCommand` object, which is returned to `TaskManagerParser`, then `LogicManager` for execution.

Step 6: `LogicManager` calls on the `execute()` method of the `EditTodoCommand` object, which edits the `ToDo` in the ScheDar's task manager.

Step 7: Upon successful execution, a `CommandResult` object is created, and returned to `LogicManager` and then the UI, where a success message is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how a typical add operation, as explained in steps 2 to 7 above, works:

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
  
##### Aspect: How commands to edit different types of tasks are implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each type of task has its own edit command.
  * Pros: The parser would be aware of the type of task being edited, and can show the user an error message if an invalid parameter is edited.
  * Cons: There are multiple edit commands, and the commands are longer, making the process more inconvenient for users.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Have a single `edit` command, with the type of task being determined by its index number provided.
  * Pros: The command is easier for user.
  * Cons: The logic needed to process the command would be more complex. More error prone.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### **Challenge 1: 3 different types of `Task`**

The fact that there are 3 different types of tasks, each extending the base `Task` abstract class, presented a lot of interesting challenges. 
    The original AB3 only had 1 entity, `Person`, being managed by the `AddressBook`. At a high level, you might say the same thing about ScheDar, with only `Task` being managed by `TaskManager`.
    However, since there are multiple subclasses of `Task`, we had to take careful consideration in our design of the `ToDo`, `Deadline` and `Event` subclasses and the `TaskManager` itself, to ensure that all features were compatible with all subclasses.


An example of this challenge was in implementing the `done` and `undo` commands. Our initial implementation of `done` was simple, just updating the `DoneStatus` of all 3 classes of `Task`.
    However, this could not work with our `undo` command, making it unable to roll back any `done` operation. We had to reimplement `done` in a way that is closer to an `edit` operation, creating a new copy of the `Task` with the new `DoneStatus` before it could be compatible with the `undo` command.  


### **Challenge 2: Team size**

With a team size of just 3 people, we were always under the constraints of manpower and time. Many tasks have a fixed base effort required, such as team tasks.
Teams with more members can afford to split the work (such as DG and UG updates, JAR relelases, etc. ) among more members, thus reducing the time that team members need to spend on non-coding tasks and letting team members focus on implementing their own features.

The small team size also restricted our ability to implement many features. As not all team members are similarly strong or quick coders, we had to try to optimize how tasks are divided to ensure maximum work is done in the shortest amount of time, and this might lead to unequal contribution when measured by lines-of-code.
However, we did try to ensure that team members spent about the same amount of time and effort on the project, while trying to maximize outcomes. With an additional member or two, we believe that we could have implemented more features and worked more efficiently, improving team performance (before hitting the point of diminishing marginal returns).
