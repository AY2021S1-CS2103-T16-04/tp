* Task management: Tracking of deadlines for todos, homework, project, etc., and assigning of various priority levels for the different tasks
* Different views: A daily, weekly, and monthly view for users to get a quick overview of current and upcoming tasks and events, and allow sorting based on deadline, priority, and other criteria.
